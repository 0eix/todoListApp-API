# todoListApp-API

This is a simple web service for a todo-list application built using Spring Boot. 
It is used as an example of the logic-tier in a 3-tiers architecture.

It retrieves data from a [RMI server](https://github.com/eoamegassi/todoListApp-Persistence) 
and offers services to interact with them via a [client app](https://github.com/eoamegassi/todoListApp-client).
